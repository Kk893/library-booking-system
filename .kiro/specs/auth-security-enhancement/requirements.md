# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the authentication and security system of the library booking application by implementing comprehensive security measures that full-stack developers typically use in production applications. The current system has basic authentication but lacks several critical security features including proper session management, advanced rate limiting, security monitoring, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Session Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to implement secure session management with proper token handling, so that user sessions are protected against hijacking and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate both access tokens (15 minutes) and refresh tokens (7 days) with proper expiration
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh endpoint to generate new tokens without requiring re-login
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all tokens and clear secure cookies
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate all user sessions
5. IF a token is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide token blacklisting functionality

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want advanced rate limiting and DDoS protection, so that the application remains available and performs well under attack or high load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed defined limits THEN the system SHALL implement sliding window rate limiting with different limits per endpoint
2. WHEN brute force attacks are detected THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and temporary IP blocking
3. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust rate limits dynamically
4. IF multiple failed attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement CAPTCHA verification for subsequent attempts
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log incidents for security monitoring

### Requirement 3: Input Validation and Sanitization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input validation and sanitization, so that the application is protected against injection attacks and malformed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs using Joi schemas with strict validation rules
2. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
3. WHEN SQL-like queries are constructed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
4. IF XSS attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL sanitize and escape all user-generated content
5. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL validate request structure and data types

### Requirement 4: Security Headers and HTTPS Configuration

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper security headers and HTTPS configuration, so that the application is protected against common web vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any HTTP response is sent THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS configuration
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN the system SHALL use secure, httpOnly, and sameSite attributes
4. IF mixed content is detected THEN the system SHALL block or upgrade insecure requests
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers with restricted origins

### Requirement 5: Security Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want comprehensive security monitoring and logging, so that I can detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log all authentication attempts, privilege escalations, and suspicious activities
2. WHEN anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger real-time alerts and notifications
3. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL include structured logging with correlation IDs for tracking
4. IF security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails with tamper-proof logging
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide security dashboards and reporting

### Requirement 6: Password Security and Multi-Factor Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want strong password security and optional multi-factor authentication, so that my account is protected even if my password is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create passwords THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password policies with complexity requirements
2. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt with high cost factors and salt
3. WHEN users enable 2FA THEN the system SHALL support TOTP-based authentication with backup codes
4. IF password breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL force password resets for affected accounts
5. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL implement secure reset flows with time-limited tokens

### Requirement 7: API Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization, so that sensitive data and operations are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement API key authentication for external integrations
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication steps
3. WHEN API responses contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement field-level encryption
4. IF unauthorized API access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block requests and log security events
5. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide security guidelines and best practices

### Requirement 8: Database Security and Encryption

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want comprehensive database security and encryption, so that sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt PII and sensitive fields at the database level
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections with certificate validation
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent injection
4. IF database anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts and automatic responses
5. WHEN data is backed up THEN the system SHALL encrypt backup files and secure storage locations

### Requirement 9: Security Testing and Vulnerability Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated security testing and vulnerability management, so that security issues are identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed THEN the system SHALL run automated security scans and vulnerability assessments
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL check for known vulnerabilities and security advisories
3. WHEN security tests are executed THEN the system SHALL include penetration testing scenarios and security unit tests
4. IF vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide automated patching and remediation workflows
5. WHEN security reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include risk assessments and remediation priorities

### Requirement 10: Compliance and Privacy Protection

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want privacy protection and regulatory compliance features, so that the application meets legal and regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is collected THEN the system SHALL implement privacy controls and consent management
2. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL provide data anonymization and pseudonymization capabilities
3. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL implement right-to-be-forgotten functionality
4. IF data breaches occur THEN the system SHALL provide incident response and notification workflows
5. WHEN compliance audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit trails and documentation
