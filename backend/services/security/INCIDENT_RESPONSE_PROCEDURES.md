# Security Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive incident response procedures for the library booking application's security system. It provides step-by-step guidance for detecting, classifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

## Incident Classification

### Incident Types

1. **Data Breach** - Unauthorized access to sensitive user data
2. **Unauthorized Access** - Access attempts without proper authentication
3. **Brute Force Attack** - Repeated login attempts to compromise accounts
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Attempts to gain higher system privileges
5. **Malware Detection** - Detection of malicious software
6. **DDoS Attack** - Distributed denial of service attacks
7. **Insider Threat** - Security threats from internal users
8. **System Compromise** - Compromise of system integrity
9. **Data Exfiltration** - Unauthorized data extraction
10. **Account Takeover** - Compromise of user accounts

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to system security or data integrity
- **High**: Significant security risk requiring urgent attention
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk requiring timely response
- **Low**: Minor security concern requiring monitoring

## Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis

#### Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects incidents through:
- Security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Threshold-based alerting
- Pattern recognition

#### Manual Detection
Security incidents may also be detected through:
- User reports
- System administrator observations
- External security alerts
- Audit findings

#### Initial Analysis Steps
1. **Verify the Incident**
   - Confirm the incident is genuine
   - Eliminate false positives
   - Gather initial evidence

2. **Classify the Incident**
   - Determine incident type
   - Assess severity level
   - Identify affected systems/users

3. **Document Initial Findings**
   - Record incident details
   - Capture relevant logs
   - Note timeline of events

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Short-term Containment
- **Account Lockdown**: Suspend compromised accounts
- **IP Blocking**: Block malicious IP addresses
- **Service Isolation**: Isolate affected services
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement emergency rate limits

#### Long-term Containment
- **System Patching**: Apply security patches
- **Configuration Changes**: Update security configurations
- **Access Control Updates**: Modify access permissions
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Increase monitoring coverage

### Phase 3: Eradication

#### Remove Threat Vectors
- **Malware Removal**: Clean infected systems
- **Vulnerability Patching**: Fix security vulnerabilities
- **Account Cleanup**: Remove unauthorized accounts
- **Configuration Hardening**: Strengthen security settings

#### Verify Eradication
- **Security Scans**: Run comprehensive security scans
- **Log Analysis**: Analyze logs for remaining threats
- **System Testing**: Test system functionality
- **Monitoring Verification**: Confirm monitoring effectiveness

### Phase 4: Recovery

#### System Restoration
- **Service Restoration**: Bring systems back online
- **Data Recovery**: Restore from clean backups if needed
- **User Access Restoration**: Restore legitimate user access
- **Monitoring Resumption**: Resume normal monitoring

#### Validation
- **Functionality Testing**: Verify system functionality
- **Security Testing**: Confirm security measures

## Technical Response Procedures

### Data Breach Response

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Block suspicious IP addresses
   iptables -A INPUT -s [SUSPICIOUS_IP] -j DROP
   
   # Suspend affected user accounts
   db.users.updateMany(
     { _id: { $in: [AFFECTED_USER_IDS] } },
     { $set: { accountLocked: true, lockReason: "Security incident" } }
   )
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Capture system logs
   journalctl --since="[INCIDENT_START]" > incident_logs.txt
   
   # Capture network traffic
   tcpdump -w incident_traffic.pcap
   ```

3. **Assess Impact**
   ```javascript
   // Query affected data
   const affectedRecords = await db.collection.find({
     accessedAt: { $gte: incidentStartTime },
     accessedBy: { $in: suspiciousUserIds }
   });
   ```

### Brute Force Attack Response

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Block Attack Sources**
   ```javascript
   // Implement IP blocking
   await rateLimitService.blockIP(attackerIP, '24h');
   
   // Increase rate limits
   await rateLimitService.adjustRateLimits('auth', {
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
     max: 3
   });
   ```

2. **Protect Targeted Accounts**
   ```javascript
   // Force password reset for targeted accounts
   await Promise.all(targetedAccounts.map(async (email) => {
     await passwordResetService.forcePasswordReset(email, 'Security incident');
   }));
   ```

### Privilege Escalation Response

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Revoke Elevated Privileges**
   ```javascript
   // Remove elevated privileges
   await db.users.updateOne(
     { _id: suspiciousUserId },
     { 
       $set: { 
         role: 'user',
         privilegeEscalationFlag: true,
         accountLocked: true
       }
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Audit Privilege Changes**
   ```javascript
   // Review recent privilege changes
   const privilegeChanges = await auditTrailService.getEvents({
     eventType: 'privilege_change',
     timeRange: { start: incidentStartTime, end: new Date() }
   });
   ```
